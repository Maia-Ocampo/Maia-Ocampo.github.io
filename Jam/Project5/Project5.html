			<h3>
				<p> 
					During Global Game Jam 2024, myself and 7  others others teamed up to make Hell's Toybox a 2D point and click game where you play as a shopkeeper trying to appease the children of Hell by fulfilling their toy less than conventional toy orders.

				</p>

				<p>
					During this game jam, I took on the role of producer, coordinating task distribution, prioritizing goals among team members, and overseeing copywriting and advertising graphics. I also managed the planning and organization for our submission. In addition, I served as the UI/UX designer, where I drafted the HUD for various game screens and created the final on-screen elements to enhance the user experience.
