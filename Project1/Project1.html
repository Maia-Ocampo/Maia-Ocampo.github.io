					Role: Production Manager

			</h2>


			<h3>
				<p> 
					In Spring 2024, I served as the Production Manager for Masonâ€™s Analysis and Design Interest Group, overseeing the development of a dynamic action-adventure game set in an urban landscape transformed by lush greenery, jungles, and woodlands. Across three action-packed levels, players team up to defeat the minions of the Phantomato of the Opera.
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
					In this role, I was responsible for tracking the progress of a multidisciplinary team, ensuring that tasks were completed efficiently and aligned with our project goals. I collaborated closely with the administrative team and discipline directors to maintain scope, manage timelines, and work to overcome any roadblocks.On top of this, I coordiated with Admin team to launch efforts towards priortizing visbility of the game not only during release but also before and after, our games increasing in pages visits by 30% according to Itch's website analytics.
